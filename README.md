# Historical Data Analysis: Volatility, Correlation & Portfolio Risk

This repository contains my **Financial Risk Management (FRM)** project where I analyzed historical stock price data of 10 Indian companies across multiple sectors. The project focuses on **volatility, correlation, and portfolio diversification** to understand risk management in equity portfolios.

## üìå Project Overview
The financial markets are highly dynamic, with stock prices fluctuating daily. To manage investment risk, two important concepts are:
- **Volatility**: Measures the variability of returns.
- **Correlation**: Explains how stocks move in relation to each other.

By combining these measures, I built dashboards to evaluate both individual stock risk and overall **portfolio volatility**.

## üéØ Objectives
- Calculate **daily returns** and measure volatility over different periods (1Y, 6M, 90D, 30D).  
- Compute **correlation coefficients** between stock pairs.  
- Create **visualizations** (line charts, correlation matrix, KPIs) in Excel and Power BI.  
- Evaluate **portfolio volatility** with weighted allocations to assess diversification benefits.  

## üè¢ Companies Analyzed
- Infosys  
- HDFC Bank  
- HUL  
- Tata Motors  
- Reliance Industries  
- Sun Pharma  
- Tata Steel  
- Bharti Airtel  
- Nestle  
- Asian Paints  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Bloomberg Terminal** (for data collection)  
- **Excel** (initial correlation & volatility calculations)  
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboards & portfolio volatility)  

## üìä Key Insights
- Cyclical stocks (Tata Motors, Tata Steel) showed higher volatility compared to defensive stocks (Nestle, HUL).  
- Portfolio diversification reduced the overall portfolio volatility to **12.42%**, lower than individual stock volatilities.  
- Correlation analysis revealed that highly correlated stocks increase portfolio risk, while combining low-correlation stocks provides stability.

## üôå Reflections
This project was a major learning curve for me. It helped me blend **finance with analytics**, automate calculations with DAX in Power BI, and understand how diversification truly minimizes portfolio risk.  

A big thank you to **Prof. Pratik Purohit** and the **BAF Department of St. Xavier‚Äôs College, Mumbai** for assigning such projects that allow us to go beyond theory and apply concepts through real-world analysis. It truly deepened my understanding of Financial Risk Management.
